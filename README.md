# Pravega Flink Connectors [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pravega/flink-connectors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pravega/flink-connectors)

This repository implements connectors to read and write [Pravega](http://pravega.io/) Streams with [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/) stream processing framework.

The connectors can be used to build end-to-end stream processing pipelines (see [Samples](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-samples)) that use Pravega as the stream storage and message bus, and Apache Flink for computation over the streams.


## Features & Highlights

  - **Exactly-once processing guarantees** for both Reader and Writer, supporting **end-to-end exactly-once processing pipelines**

  - Seamless integration with Flink's checkpoints and savepoints.

  - Parallel Readers and Writers supporting high throughput and low latency processing.

  - Table API support to access Pravega Streams for both **Batch** and **Streaming** use case.

## Documentation
To learn more about how to build and use the Flink Connector library, follow the connector documentation [here](http://pravega.io/).

More examples on how to use the connectors with Flink application can be found in [Pravega Samples](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-samples) repository.
