# Apache Flink Connectors for Pravega

This documentation describes the connectors API and it's usage to read and write [Pravega](http://pravega.io/) streams with [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/) stream processing framework.

Build end-to-end stream processing pipelines that use Pravega as the stream storage and message bus, and Apache Flink for computation over the streams. See the [Pravega Concepts](http://pravega.io/docs/pravega-concepts/) page for more information.
